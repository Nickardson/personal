## About

A web game of SHENZHEN Solitiare, a unique variant of solitaire.

## Design

The project can use the original assets from the SHENZHEN I/O game, and will look nearly identical to the original. If the assets aren't available, a fallback stylesheet is applied to create an alternative look that is just as functional.

Uses drag-and-drop to move groups of cards around, and animations as cards fly around for a classic solitaire win animation.
