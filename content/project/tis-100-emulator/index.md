A web emulator for TIS-100. This fictional microprocessor has an assembly-like instruction set, and runs programs in unusual grid-based "CPU"s.

The game's puzzles are defined in a Lua script to allow for complex, sandÂ­boxed user-defined specifications. My emulator also loads these user-defined puzzles using lua.vm.js.
