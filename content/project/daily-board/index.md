My Daily Board helps my Scrum team (and yours too!) to run our daily standup.

Authorize the app to view your Azure Devops (VSTS) tasks and teams. Then each day, the daily standup organizer brings up the page to provide a visual of what tasks were completed since the last standup, and what's in progress.

Uses ASP.NET core, Vue.js and Material design for a crisp-looking, light-weight utility for users from any organization.
