My UCF capstone project, for the company CodeCraft Works.

The site allows CodeCraft instructors to set up a profile, and allows CodeCraft's partners to post when and where they will offer their coding courses.

Using Angular and the Firebase Realtime Database, the site will broadcast relevant database updates. User changes are immediately visible to any other users viewing it.

The site makes use of responsive mobile breakpoints for a great viewing experience on desktop or mobile, and is an single-page application which provides a snappy browsing experience.
